# common/networking.nix — Tailscale, the firewall lockdown, and base SSH.
# Everything else in this repo depends on the firewall policy set here:
# trustedInterfaces means any service that binds 0.0.0.0 is automatically
# tailnet-only with zero extra config, which is why none of the other
# service files (jellyfin.nix, couchdb.nix, forgejo.nix, sftp.nix) need
# any firewall rules of their own.
