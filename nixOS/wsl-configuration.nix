# wsl-configuration.nix
# The WSL target — requires NixOS-WSL (https://github.com/nix-community/NixOS-WSL),
# a real NixOS system running as its own WSL2 distro. This is NOT the same
# as "Nix installed on top of Ubuntu-WSL" — that setup has no NixOS
# underneath it and can't run nixos-rebuild at all, which is what you hit
# earlier. See README for how to actually install NixOS-WSL first.
#
# No bootloader, no disk partitioning, no hardware-configuration.nix here —
# the wsl.nix module (from the nixos-wsl input) handles all of that, since
# WSL2 owns the underlying virtual disk and boot process itself.

  # WSL2 provides its own network stack via the Windows host — no
  # NetworkManager needed (unlike the real-machine target).
